                    <p>Hi there! My name is Adweta Sigdel, and I am undergraduate student. I am currently studying BSc. Computing at The British College in Kathmandu, Nepal.<br><br> I have a basic knowledge of coding and graphics, and I am excited to develop these skills further as I continue my studies.In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I love experimenting with new recipes and trying out different cuisines. I find that cooking is not only a relaxing activity but also a great way to express my creativity.
                        I am also an avid reader and enjoy getting lost in a good book. Whether it's a classic novel or the latest bestseller, I always have a book on hand. Reading helps me broaden my perspective and learn new things.
                       <br><br> Playing badminton is another one of my hobbies. I find it to be a great way to stay active and improve my hand-eye coordination. I enjoy playing both casually with friends and competitively in local leagues.
                       <br><br> Lastly, I enjoy sketching. I find it to be a great way to express my creativity and relax. Whether it's a quick sketch or a detailed drawing, I enjoy the process of bringing my ideas to life on paper.
                        <br><br>Overall, I am a curious and creative person who is passionate about learning and exploring new things. I am excited to see where my studies in computing will take me and look forward to continuing to pursue my hobbies and interests alongside my academic pursuits.</p>
